					<h3>Deliberately introduced dung beetles in Australia: 12 years of occurrence and abundance records
						from 2001 to 2022 <span class="image right"><img src="images/delib_intro.JPG" alt="" /></span>

					<h6>Abstract:</h6>
					<p>Since 1968, the Australian Dung Beetle Project has carried out field releases of 43 deliberately
						introduced dung beetle species for the biological control of livestock dung and dung-breeding
						pests. Of these, 23 species are known to have become established. For most of these species,
						sufficient time has elapsed for population expansion to fill the extent of their potential
						geographic range through both natural and human-assisted dispersal. Consequently, over the last
						20â€‰years, extensive efforts have been made to quantify the current distribution of these
						introduced dung beetles, as well as the seasonal and spatial variation in their activity levels.
						Much of these data and their associated metadata have remained unpublished, and they have not
						previously been synthesized into a cohesive dataset. Here, we collate and report data from the
						three largest dung beetle monitoring projects from 2001 to 2022. Together, these projects
						encompass data collected from across Australia, and include records for all 23 species of
						established dung beetles introduced for biocontrol purposes. In total, these data include 22,718
						presence records and 213,538 absence records collected during 10,272 sampling events at 546
						locations. Most presence records (97%) include abundance data. In total, 1,752,807 dung beetles
						were identified as part of these data. The distributional occurrence and abundance data can be
						used to explore questions such as factors influencing dung beetle species distributions, dung
						beetle biocontrol, and insect-mediated ecosystem services. These data are provided under a
						CC-BY-NC 4.0 license and users are encouraged to cite this data paper when using the data.</p>

					<h3>Dung removal increases under higher dung beetle functional diversity regardless of grazing
						intensification<span class="image right"><img src="images/dung_rem_image.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					</h3>
					<h6> Authors: Noriega, J.A., Hortal, J., deCastro-Arrazola, I. <i>et al.</i> </h6>
					<h6> Year: 2023 </h6>
					<h6> Journal: Nature Communications</h6>
					<h6>DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-43760-8 </h6>
					<h6>Abstract:</h6>
					<p> Dung removal by macrofauna such as dung beetles is an important process for nutrient cycling in
						pasturelands. Intensification of farming practices generally reduces species and functional
						diversity of terrestrial invertebrates, which may negatively affect ecosystem services. Here, we
						investigate the effects of cattle-grazing intensification on dung removal by dung beetles in
						field experiments replicated in 38 pastures around the world. Within each study site, we
						measured dung removal in pastures managed with low- and high-intensity regimes to assess
						between-regime differences in dung beetle diversity and dung removal, whilst also considering
						climate and regional variations. The impacts of intensification were heterogeneous, either
						diminishing or increasing dung beetle species richness, functional diversity, and dung removal
						rates. The effects of beetle diversity on dung removal were more variable across sites than
						within sites. Dung removal increased with species richness across sites, while functional
						diversity consistently enhanced dung removal within sites, independently of cattle grazing
						intensity or climate. Our findings indicate that, despite intensified cattle stocking rates,
						ecosystem services related to decomposition and nutrient cycling can be maintained when a
						functionally diverse dung beetle community inhabits the human-modified landscape.</p>

					<h3>A simple technique to assess resource use in dung beetle breeding studies <span
							class="image right"><img src="images/glitter_pub.jpg" alt="" /></span></h3>
					<h6> Authors: Lewis, M. J., Berson, J. D., Didham, R. K. and Evans, T. A.</h6>
					<h6> Year: 2023 </h6>
					<h6> Journal: Ecological Entomology</h6>
					<h6>DOI: 10.1111/een.13277</h6>
					<h6>Abstract:</h6>
					<p>Current methods for identifying resource preferences in dung beetles are based on above-ground
						trials. Although useful, these methods do not directly investigate resource provisioning of
						offspring below ground, missing an important part of dung beetle ecology. We tested the
						potential for UV-fluorescent and non-fluorescent coloured glitters to be used as markers for
						tracing the origin of dung incorporated into brood balls (dung shaped by parental beetles
						enclosing an egg), and so aid in a more complete understanding of resource use in dung beetles.
						We tested the effect of glitter addition on brood ball production in two species of tunnelling
						dung beetles, <i>Onthophagus taurus</i> and <i>Euoniticellus fulvus</i>.There was no effect of
						glitter addition on brood ball production during no-choice tests for each species: both species
						made a similar number of brood balls, regardless of glitter presence or glitter colour. In a
						separate choice trial, <i>O. taurus</i> showed no preference for dung when presented with four
						dung pats containing four unique glitter colours. Here we show that glitter can be used as an
						effective marker of individual brood ball origin in tunnelling dung beetles. This method
						provides a useful tool for tracking below ground resource use and larval provisioning
						experiments in dung beetles.</p>
